Developed a Spring Boot application for comprehensive employee management.
The Employee Management Service provides full CRUD functionality.
CRUD operations include Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT), and Delete (DELETE).
Postman was utilized for testing and validating all API endpoints.
MySQL was used as the database to persist employee data.
All CRUD operations are functioning correctly based on the requirements.
