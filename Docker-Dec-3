Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.
It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production
Docker images can be built automatically in CI pipelines, ensuring every code change produces a clean, reproducible environment.
In CD pipelines, Docker containers are deployed to environments such as Kubernetes, ECS, or Docker Swarm for reliable and scalable releases.
Docker enables faster delivery cycles by standardizing builds, simplifying deployments, and reducing time spent on environment setup.
